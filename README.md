# How To Blog

Disclaimer. The project is intended as a learning curve of web development with Python from a QA perspective. It doesn't aim to be a hands-on application. This web application allows users to view blog posts, read about the author, and send messages through a contact form.

## Features

- Responsive design for all devices ([Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/))
- Dynamic blog posts loaded from an external API ([Npoint](https://www.npoint.io/))
- Individual post pages with detailed content
- About page with author information
- Contact form with email notification functionality

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd how_to_blog

   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```
   MY_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   MY_PASSWORD=your-email-password
   SMTP_SERVER=your-smtp-server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
